Known Bugs:
-when launching script with the '-d' option if you pass a '-l' loglevel instead of '-1' the script bombs
-Bug in alarm info when BSRName deviates from XXXXXXXNNNNN format (e.g., spaces in name for lab ap's)
-Fix up regex matching, example: typing "exit" tries to send email
-with 2+index, alarm timestamps not displaying properly
-put validation into food csv
-UNVERIFIED: bad password handling
-In alarm view (9+XX) IuPS etc alarms show up as adminStatus 'locked' which is wrong.
-add better TIMEOUT handling to reboot sequence
-fix date sort order in cell up/down log

REQUESTS:
-Ignore 'lmcFailure' alarms completely. 

Known Limitations:
-The usefulness of the script depends upon having fresh data. Fresh data is awkward to obtain for most users.
--Want to write in a "if db older than 4 hrs force refresh"
--Future development goals include behind-the-scenes data refreshes.
-The WICL 'FM ClearAlarm' command does not work. There is already an AR open with ALU (AR1-5424256)
--If the clearalarm command worked the tool could be much more robust.
